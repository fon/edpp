    abstract = {{JDBM2 provides HashMap and TreeMap which are backed by disk storage. It is very easy and fast way to persist your data. JDBM2 also have minimal hardware requirements and is highly embeddable (jar have only 145 KB).

JDBM2 was develop to support astronomical calculation with data which does not fit into memory. It also provides storage for astronomical planetarium Asterope.

JDBM started 10 years ago as GDBM port to Java. Original version was developed by Cees De Groot, Alex Boisvert and others. Last version 1.0 was released in 2005 and is used since then with little bugs found. This project is 1.0 fork, which adds more features and performance improvements.

Plus:

    Fast, very small footprint
    Transactional
    Standalone jar have only 145 KB.
    Simple usage
    Scales well up to 1e9 records
    Uses Java serialization, no ORM mapping 

Cons:

    Synchronized on one 'big lock', does not scale well with concurrent access
    Only one single concurrent transaction
    No triggers, foreign keys and other integrity checks... (compared to SQL database)
    No J2EE or Spring like support 

This project can be best compared to Oracle BerkleyDB Java Edition, but is distributed under more liberal Apache 2 license and is free as beer.}},

The scheme first transforms \$A\$ to a bidiagonal matrix \$J\$, then diagonalizes \$J\$. The scheme described here is complicated but does not suffer from the computational difficulties which occasionally afflict some previously known methods.

    abstract = {{Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, ISO created a new subcommittee for "Open Systems Interconnection" (ISO/ TC97/SC 16) in 1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for the following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.}},
